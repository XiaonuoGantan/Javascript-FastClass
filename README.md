# Why?
Native Javascript Inheritance is a pin in the ass. Even if you understand it perfectly it stills requires some hidous repetivie code.

There are a lot of libraries which aims to help you with such that, but the question is:
What's [`the fastest`](http://jsperf.com/js-inheritance-performance/25) vs `most convenient` to create `Prototypal Inheritance` with?

# What?
FastClass is a very tiny library that helps you quickly derrive your `classes` so to speak.


# Where?
Beside GitHub, you can download it as a [Nuget package](http://nuget.org/packages/Javascript-FastClass/) in Visual Studio from [here](http://nuget.org/packages/Javascript-FastClass/)
```javascript
Install-Package Javascript-FastClass
```
