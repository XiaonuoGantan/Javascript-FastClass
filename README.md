* [Performance Tests among fastest only](http://jsperf.com/js-inheritance-performance/26)

## Why?
Native Javascript Inheritance is a pin in the ass. Even if you understand it perfectly it stills requires some hidous repetivie code.

There are a lot of libraries which aims to help you with such that, but the main question is:
Which is [`the fastest`](http://jsperf.com/js-inheritance-performance/25) vs [`most convenient`](https://github.com/njoubert/inheritance.js/blob/master/INHERITANCE.md) to create `Prototypal Inheritance` with?

## When?
You do need this library when you can't use a language that [`compiles`](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS){:target="_blank"} into javascript

## What?
FastClass is a very tiny library that helps you quickly derrive your `classes` so to speak.


# Where?
Beside GitHub, you can download it as a [Nuget package](http://nuget.org/packages/Javascript-FastClass/) in Visual Studio from [here](http://nuget.org/packages/Javascript-FastClass/)
```javascript
Install-Package Javascript-FastClass
```
